	abstract = {To simulate transient wind turbine wake interaction problems using limited wind turbine data, two new variants of the actuator line technique are proposed in which the rotor blade forces are computed locally using generic load data. The proposed models, which are extensions of the actuator disk force models proposed by Navarro Diaz et al. (2019a) and Sørensen et al. (2020), only demand thrust and power coefﬁcients and the tip speed ratio as input parameters. In the paper the analogy between the actuator disk model (ADM) and the actuator line model (ALM) is shown, and from this a simple methodology to implement local forces in the ALM without the need for knowledge of blade geometry and local airfoil data is derived. Two simpliﬁed variants of ALMs are proposed, an analytical one based on Sørensen et al. (2020) and a numerical one based on Navarro Diaz et al. (2019a). The proposed models are compared to the ADM using analogous data, as well as to the classical ALM based on blade element theory, which provides more detailed force distributions by using airfoil data. To evaluate the local force calculation, the analysis of a partial-wake interaction case between two wind turbines is carried out for a uniform laminar inﬂow and for a turbulent neutral atmospheric boundary layer inﬂow. The computations are performed using the large eddy simulation facility in Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM), including Simulator for Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) libraries and the reference National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW wind turbine as the test case. In the single-turbine case, computed normal and tangential force distributions along the blade showed a very good agreement between the employed models. The two new ALMs exhibited the same distribution as the ALM based on geometry and airfoil data, with minor differences due to the particular tip correction needed in the ALM. For the challenging partially impacted wake case, both the analytical and the numerical approaches manage to correctly capture the force distribution at the different regions of the rotor area, with, however, a consistent overestimation of the normal force outside the wake and an underestimation inside the wake. The analytical approach shows a slightly better performance in wake impact cases compared to the numerical one. As expected, the ALMs gave a much more detailed prediction of the higher-frequency power output ﬂuctuations than the ADM. These promising ﬁndings open the possibility to simulate commercial wind farms in transient inﬂows using the ALM without having to get access to actual wind turbine and airfoil data, which in most cases are restricted due to conﬁdentiality.},

	abstract = {Commercially available wind yield assessment models rely on superposition of wakes calculated for isolated single turbines. These methods of wake simulation fail to account for emergent flow physics that may affect the behaviour of multiple turbines and their wakes and therefore wind farm yield predictions. In this paper wake-wake interaction is modelled computationally (CFD) and physically (in a hydraulic flume) to investigate physical causes of discrepancies between analytical modelling and simulations or measurements. Three effects, currently neglected in commercial models, are identified as being of importance: 1) when turbines are directly aligned, the combined wake is shortened relative to the single turbine wake; 2) when wakes are adjacent, each will be lengthened due to reduced mixing; and 3) the pressure field of downstream turbines can move and modify wakes flowing close to them.},

	abstract = {In this work, CFD simulation along with the site complete wind rose are used for the ﬁrst time to estimate a key magnitude for the project development of a wind farm, the capacity factor, which is directly related with the energy yield. The large computational cost that restricted CFD simulation for such a task is drastically reduced by means of a novel interpolation-extrapolation methodology, requiring the simulation of only three inlet velocities for each wind rose sector. This methodology is based on the velocity at met mast and results of the reference velocity for each wind turbine from pre-simulated cases, which are then used to compute a wide range of cases not explicitly simulated. A comparative study is carried out, in which the measured capacity factor of an onshore wind farm in the Argentinean Patagonia is compared against different solution approaches. In the particular case of this wind farm, it is found that the separate effects of wakes and terrain produce errors in the opposite sense, and results very close to the measured value are achieved when both are considered. Also, the increase in the number of simulated direction sectors from 16 to 32 does not signiﬁcantly change the results.},

	abstract = {Transient phenomena such as abrupt changes in wind direction occur frequently during the operation of wind farms. The wakes produced behind wind turbines are affected by these situations, modifying the impact on nearby turbines, both in power output and life expectancy of the blades. In this work, a group of 4 turbines in a wind farm is analysed via Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations during wind shifts. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are carried out by means of the open-source software OpenFOAM, including the SOWFA libraries. Once the wakes reach a time average stationary solution the wind direction is modified by means of a pressure gradient forcing, imposing different change rates. An actuator disk with the ability to correct yaw misalignment is used to represent turbines. Besides, neutral Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flows are considered. Results show that for higher change rates the greatest impact on the downwind turbine is produced when turbines are no longer collinear with wind direction due to the wake curvature. Also, higher change rates produce a higher curvature modifying the impact on power output of downwind turbines. This study provides a deeper understanding of the cause of greater deficits in wind farm output.},
